Activity: modify output of hello world
======================================

It's time to start your programming journey! Following along the same path as every 
beginning programmer, you will write your first program. Your goal is to write a variant 
of the famous "Hello world" program, to make sure that you know how to use the tools we provide in this course.

Instead of "Hello world!" you should display the following text:

Hello MOOC!

Warning: In order for the grading tool to recognize your solution as correct, 
you must print this text exactly as shown above.
*/

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
    printf("Hello MOOC!");
    return 0;
}
